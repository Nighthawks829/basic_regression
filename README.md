# Basic regression : Concrete Strength Prediction
There Various Factors that affects the Strength of Concrete Such as Materials Used, Age etc.
Predict the Strength of the Concrete Based on the Components and Other Factors as Predictors.

## About Dataset
There Various Factors that affects the Strength of Concrete Such as Materials Used, Age etc.
Predict the Strength of the Concrete Based on the Components and Other Factors as Predictors.

**Description of Fields are as follows:-**

- CementComponent:- Amount of cement is mixed
- BlastFurnaceSlag:- Amount of Blast Furnace Slag is mixed
- FlyAshComponent:- Amount of FlyAsh is mixed
- WaterComponent:- Amount of water is mixed
- SuperplasticizerComponent:- Amount of Super plasticizer is mixed
- CoarseAggregateComponent:- Amount of Coarse Aggregate is mixed
- FineAggregateComponent:- Amount of Coarse Aggregate is mixed
- AgeInDays:- How many days it was left dry
- Strength:- What was the final strength of concrete- (Target)

In a regression problem, the aim is to predict the output of a continuous value, like a price or a probability, Contrast this with a classifcation problem, where the aim is to select a class from a list of classes (for example, where a picture contains a apple or an orange, recognizing which fruis is in the picture)

This notebook uses the **Conreate Strength** dataset build models to predict the strength of concrete. This notebooks uses the Keras API.
